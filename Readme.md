# Python Turtle and OOP



## What should a Python project contains on GitHub

1. Our code :)
2. A .gitignore for Python file
3. A Readme.md describing our code, how to use it, or at least it's functionality
4. Adding a file named `requirements.txt` which describes the packages you installed alongside Python


### Tip

You use 
```shell
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
